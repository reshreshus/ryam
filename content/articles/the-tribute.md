This is what I've been secretely telling myself all the time.  
I'm not good enough to deal with the situation.  
I escape.  
I hide my ambitions.  
But the pain remains.  

I am incompetent.

This was the picture I painted.  

I am good. I deserve to feel good.  
No philisophy will change that.  
No work will change that.  
And the only thing left to do is to continue being who I am.
