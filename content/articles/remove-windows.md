I've been thinking about switching to GNU/Linux for a long time.  
It's not like I hated Windows, I had no idea how it's bad or good.  
But! I wanted to be one of the cool guys in the Internet.  
I've tried dual boot before but always went back to Windows cause it's "convenient".  
But one happy day I've decided to trash Windows completely and this is the day I've learned Linux really for the first time.  


### So, remove windows to create space for doors maybe
